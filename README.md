# __Ultimate-Markdown__

The ultimate Markdown cheatsheet! A comprehensive, (eventually) all-encompassing Markdown reference. And that's only the beginning...

Much of the beginning information can be found at the links given below, however this Readme provides a concise and well-formatted reference sheet all in one place.

Besides this reference, however, I've included a Discussions board so anyone wanting to talk about anything related to Markdown can join. I hope this can become a place where others can find a community for Markdown and a good reference and support as well.

<br>

## Why?

It started when I needed a good reference for Markdown, as I was still a beginner trying to learn how to make good and professional-looking documentation on Github, Jupyter, and for code in general. I searched through Github, it wasn't a complete search, but of several I found, it never seemed complete or as well-formatted as I thought it could be. I decided to make something more, an entire community on Github for Markdown, and a strong, yet still concise, to-the-point reference at the core of it all.

<br>

## Get Involved

Want to get involved in some way? You're welcome to! If you want to talk about the project, or anything Markdown related, you're welcome to head over to the Discussions area [here](https://github.com/SpyrossS3/Ultimate-Markdown/discussions/1#discussion-4561200).

On the other hand, if you're interested in contributing to the project in some way and adding in your own needs, then first see the formatting guide for contributors [here](https://github.com/SpyrossS3/Ultimate-Markdown/blob/main/Format%20Guide.md).

<br>

## Either way, welcome to the project! ðŸŽ‰

# Line Breaks

> In Markdown, to leave a line break, you would put two spaces after text and press enter to continue on the next line, but as this is hard to see in an editor, the HTML tag: `<br>` is a much better choice in terms of clean raw formatting.

<br>

## Code Blocks

    This is a code block.
